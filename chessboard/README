A simple chessboard created using HTML, CSS and some JavaScript.
This was created to try out unicode and display flex features.

I used Chrome for testing, and did not add vendor-specific prefixes for css.

Note: I have no intention to add game features to the chessboard.

To Do:
1) Refactor JavaScript (DRY principle).
