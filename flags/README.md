Today, I was looking around in web for inspiration whether anybody has recreated world nation's flags using css.

I found Tim Carry's awesome work at https://pixelastic.github.io/css-flags/. He has kept some restrictions on how the flags were created, e.g. "using only one div per flag". This seems to be challenging, and I would like to see how he achieved those results by trying to reproduce what he achieved.
